This README has three sections:
* WebsocketServer usage: instructions to run the WebsocketServer for integration with the main system
* Main Resources: the "primary"/"most used" resouces and where to find them in this repository
* Other Resources: the resources that are implemented in this repository but are secondary, with a brief description and links to more in-depth READMEs

# WebsocketServer usage
## Setup
Run ``` bash setup.sh ``` to install required dependencies.   
Disclaimer: Due to the use of Tensorflow, the WebsocketServer is not compatible with Windows.
## Usage
Run ``` bash run_server.sh ``` or ``` python main_tts.py ``` to run the server.
Run ``` bash run_client.sh ``` to run a test client that will communicate with the server.
## Docs
For more informations, see the tts_websocketserver [README.md](tts_websocketserver/README.md) 

# Main Resources
## TTS Pipeline
Currently located at: [tts_pipeline/](tts_pipeline)  
This repository defines the skeleton of the pipelines used at inference time, a first design of the pipeline can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Cx96uZUxc3dx-PRyFl2v2R7lmjZ05UeixxwqPsBeEBQ/edit#slide=id.gbf06894dcc_0_30).  
For informations on how to use TTS Pipeline, please read its [README.md](tts_pipeline/README.md)  
### **NOTE**:
There is a newly implemented keyword extractor: ``` tts_pipeline.pipelines.waterfall.models.UnifiedKeywordPairsExtractorV3.UnifiedKeywordPairsExtractorV3 ```  
This keyword extractor is not currently used in tts_websocketserver since the older version (``` tts_pipeline.pipelines.waterfall.models.UnifiedKeywordPairsExtractorV2 ```) is currently under evaluation.  
The newer version is supposed to be smarter and give better keyword matchings. More infos can be found in the doctring of the ``` UnifiedKeywordPairsExtractorV3 ``` class    

## TTS WebsocketServer
Currently located at: [tts_websocketserver/](tts_websocketserver/)  
This repository holds the implementation of a websocket server that exposes TTS Pipeline's prediction functionalities for the Production Team.  
For more informations on TTS WebsocketServer, please read its [README.md](tts_websocketserver/README.md)

## Git Tutorial
Currently located at: [playground/beat_toedtli/](playground/beat_toedtli/)  
A simple guideline on the structure and usage of this repository.
More details can be found in its own [README.md](playground/beat_toedtli/README.md)  

## words embeddings
Currently located at: [playground/beat_toedtli/word_embeddings](playground/beat_toedtli/word_embeddings)  
Word embeddings explorative implementations, benchmarked with [benchmarking_tools](playground/mirco_nani/embeddings_pipelines/benchmarking_tools)
More details can be found in its own [README.md](playground/beat_toedtli/word_embeddings/README.md)  

## Command Patterns Dataset
Currently located at: [playground/mirco_nani/embeddings_pipelines/commands_patterns_dataset](playground/mirco_nani/embeddings_pipelines/commands_patterns_dataset)  
A simple sentences generator to augment our dataset. It takes sentence patterns with blank tokens and replaces these tokens with given keywords. The final output consists of all the possible sentences obtainable from all the combinations of patterns and keywords.  
More details can be found in its own [README.md](playground/mirco_nani/embeddings_pipelines/commands_patterns_dataset/README.md)  

## Benchmarking Tools
Currently located at: [playground/mirco_nani/embeddings_pipelines/benchmarking_tools](playground/mirco_nani/embeddings_pipelines/benchmarking_tools)  
These tools are made to benchmark embedding models (such as BERT or sent2vec) in order to produce performances comparisons.
More details can be found in its own [README.md](playground/mirco_nani/embeddings_pipelines/benchmarking_tools/README.md)  

## Embeddings Pipelines
Currently located at: [playground/mirco_nani/embeddings_pipelines/](playground/mirco_nani/embeddings_pipelines/)   
First implementation of TTS Pipeline
